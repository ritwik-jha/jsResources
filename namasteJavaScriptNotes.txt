window object is the global object.

1. Hoisting
 --> execution context contains variable environment where variables and funcions are stored and code env where code is stored
 --> js program is executed in two phases 
	--> P1: Memory creation phase: Variables and functions are hoisted
	--> P2: Code execution phase: Code is executed
 --> undefined keyword --> placeholder
 --> first all the variables are hoisted with undefined and functions are hoisted with complete function body.
 --> then all the variables are assigned values and functions are executed.
 
2. Scope chain and lexical env
 --> every execution context can access the execution context of its parents
 --> the execution context of parent is called lexical environment.
 
 
3. let vs var vs const
 --> vars and let are hoisted with undefined initially.
 --> let variables cannot be accessed before value assignment. 
 --> the time between hoisting and value initiallization for let variable is called temporal dead zone.
 --> acessing variable in temporal dead zone gives reference error.
 --> let and const are not stored in the global object they are stored in different space
 --> let variables cannot be redeclared.
 --> const cannot be declared and initiallized later it has to be initiallized in same line.
 --> assigning diff value to const variable throws TypeError
 --> preference order:  const > let > var
 --> initiallization of variables should be done at top of code to avaoid temporal dead zone
